title: "Conditional RGB-T Fusion for Effective Crowd Counting"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-10-18-rgbt-fusion
excerpt: 'This paper is about Crowd Counting in RGB and Thermal images. Our work eliminates the need for two branches for each of these modalities as proposed in the baseline by conditionally fusing the thermal and RGB images with the help of a toggle, saliency maps, and a rolling guidance filter. Backbone is inspired from [Multi-column convolutional neural network](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Zhang_Single-Image_Crowd_Counting_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). We achieve state of the art RMSE of 6.11 on the RGBT-CC dataset, proving the importance of each component.
