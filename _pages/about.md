I am an undergrad from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India. I am pursuing a five-year programme : Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science and Masters of Science in Economics since 2019. I am currently a Summer Intern at the Media & Data Science Research Team at Adobe, India.

I am working with Prof. Kamlesh Tiwari to enhance "Semantic segmentation of remote urban iamgery using fractional calculus methods". The most satisfying and exciting project is ideating and working on "Reducing food wastage in institute messes using ML techniques", with Prof. Amitesh Singh Rajput. Previously, I have worked with Prof. Poonam Goyal at my institute on Anomaly Detection in Thermal Images.

Although my main research interest is in Computer Vision, I am actively exploring Natural Language Processing, and impacts of social media channels on the Stock Market.
